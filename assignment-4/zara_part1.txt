1.  In 100 words or less, describe DFA’s belief about how to find premium in the market.
    To what degree does their strategy rely on individual equity analysis? Macroeconomic fundamentals? Efficient markets?
    Are DFA’s funds active or passive?
    What do DFA and others mean by a “value” stock? And a “growth” stock?

DFA believes markets are broadly efficient, so return premiums come from systematic exposure to factors such as size and 
value rather than from picking individual winning stocks. Their strategy relies little on analyzing individual companies and does 
not try to predict macroeconomic trends. Their funds are passive in philosophy but structured to tilt toward factors supported 
by academic research. A value stock is one that is priced low relative to its book value, while a growth stock is priced high 
relative to its book value. 

2.  What challenge did DFA’s model see in the 1980’s?
    And in the 1990’s?

In the 1980s, the size premium appeared weaker, raising doubts about whether small-cap stocks truly outperform. In the 1990s, 
value stocks significantly underperformed growth stocks, especially during the technology boom, which challenged confidence 
in the long-run reliability of the value premium.

3.  Exhibit 3 has data regarding a universe of 5,020 firms. How many are considered "large cap”? What percent of the market value
    do they account for?
    Exhibit 6 shows that the U.S. value factor (HML) has underperformed the broader U.S. equity market in 1926-2001, including every 
    subsample except 1963-1981. So why should an investor be interested in this value factor?


In Exhibit 3, the largest segment of firms (approximately the top 500–1,000 by size) are considered large cap, and they make up 
the vast majority of total market value, around 80–90 percent. So while many firms exist, only a small number represent most of the 
market’s capitalization / value.

Even though the value factor underperformed the broader U.S. market in most subperiods from 1926–2001, investors may still be 
interested in it because its long-term average return has historically been higher, it provides diversification benefits when 
combined with growth-focused portfolios, and it may reflect compensation for risk or the correction of persistent market 
overpricing of growth stocks.
